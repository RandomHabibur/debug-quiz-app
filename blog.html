          The function quizTimer takes a single parameter dismiss. If dismiss is
          true, the function clears the timer interval and stops the timer. The
          clearInterval function is used to stop the interval previously set by
          setInterval. If dismiss is false (or not provided), the function
          proceeds to create a timer interval using setInterval. The interval
          function within setInterval updates the countdown timer display every
          second. The timer interval is set to trigger the interval function
          every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

          2) what is work of chooseQuiz()
        </div>
        <div class="my-2">Explaination:</div>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The function chooseQuiz takes two parameters: index and givenAns.
              index is the index of the quiz question in the quizData array, and
              givenAns represents the answer given by the user for that
              question.
            </li>

            <li>
              The function starts by checking if an answer with the same ID as
              the current quiz question already exists in the answers array. It
              does this by using the Array.find() method, which iterates through
              the answers array and looks for an object that has the same id
              property as the current quiz question in the quizData array.
            </li>

            <li>
              If an answer with the same ID exists (i.e., isExist is truthy), it
              means that the user has previously answered this question, and the
              function needs to update the existing answer. It enters the first
              block of the if statement.
            </li>

            <li>
              The function then iterates through the answers array using a
              for...of loop to find the index (serial) of the existing answer
              that needs to be updated.
            </li>

            <li>
              Once the correct index is found, the function uses the
              Array.splice() method to replace the existing answer at that index
              with a new object. The new object is created by spreading the
              properties of the current quiz question (quizData[index]) and
              adding the givenAns property to represent the user's answer.
            </li>

            <li>
              If an answer with the same ID does not exist (i.e., isExist is
              falsy), it means that the user is answering this question for the
              first time. The function enters the else block and pushes a new
              object to the answers array. This new object is created similarly
              to the one mentioned earlier.
            </li>

            <li>
              After updating or adding the answer, the function calls the
              displayAnswers function and passes the updated answers array as an
              argument. The purpose of this call is likely to update the UI and
              display the answers to the user.

          1) What is between map, filter, forEach, find?
        </div>
        <div>Ans:</div>
        <div>
          <span class="text-cyan-500">map</span>: The map function is used to
          transform each element of an array and create a new array with these
          values. It returns an array of the same length as the original array.
          <br /><br />

          <span class="text-cyan-500">filter</span>: The filter function is used
          to apply a specific condition and return an array with all the
          elements that fulfill the condition. <br /><br />

          <span class="text-cyan-500">forEach</span>: The forEach function is
          used to perform a specific action on each element of an array. It does
          not return or create a new array. <br /><br />

          <span class="text-cyan-500">find</span>: The find function is used to
          retrieve the first element in an array that satisfies a specific
          condition. It returns the first element that matches the condition. If
          no condition is met, it returns undefined.

          2) What is the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage &
          cookies?
        </div>
        <div>Ans:</div>
        <div>
          <span class="text-cyan-500">LocalStorage</span> is for store data in
          browser permatently. When
          <span class="text-cyan-500">sessionStorage</span> is only store data
          when only open specific tap and after close that page
          <span class="text-cyan-500">sessionStorage</span> does not save that
          data. On the other hand,
          <span class="text-cyan-500">cookies</span> are used to store data like
          login information, user preferences, and other session-related data on
          the client-side. Cookies are small text files that are sent by the
          server and stored in the user's web browser. They are commonly used to
          track user activities, personalize user experiences, and maintain
          session information as users navigate through a website. It's have a
          expired date after that cookies not working!

        </div>
        <div>Ans:</div>

          If all the statements from the call stack have finished execution
          <span class="text-cyan-500">Event Loop</span> will pop the statement
          from the event queue and push it to the call stack. This is how it
